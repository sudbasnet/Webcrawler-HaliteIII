# halite_webcrawler

I am participating in the HALITE III challenge, I just wanted to collect some basic data on games played by the top players. Two Sigma, which is the organizer of this challenge does provide us with a corpus of data was i was having trouble reading it. I mostly just wanted some basic stats so I decide to write a crawler instead.

I use selenium to replay past games and collect the data through the html data.
